                "description": "I am very happy with this GPU. I upgraded from an AMD R7 200 series card, because of difficulty playing TSW, Elite:Dangerous and using the Oculus Rift DK2.Upon opening the box I joked that EVGA had mistakenly sent me a small motherboard instead of a GPU. It is massive compared to my old AMD R7.Installation: You will need space for this beast, look at the photo included to get an idea of the size. Once I made room I had no difficulties getting the GPU to seat in the PCI connector, I did find the power connection difficult. So difficult that I removed the GPU, and spent a few minutes trying to figure out why it would not seat, I finally finessed the power input into the socket with some force. Reseated the GPU and was good to go. The GPU comes with a CD with the Drivers on it, plus overclocking software.(It is recommended that you register the GPU before the installation since the S/N can only be found on the bottom of the GPU)Playing Elite Dangerous is like night and day. Where I struggled on low/mid graphics with the R7, the 960 plays on high settings, and putting on the Oculus Rift was stunning. I am now finally able to appreciate the power of VR, Oculus needs to hurry up with the 4k consumer version it will be a must have.The Secret World is a whole new game with the visuals maxed out, a whole new game.There is nothing worse than a gamer with a sub-par rig, and after extensive research over a few days I chose the 960 and a EVGA Supernova 750W G2 power supply to fuel the beast. I am very happy that I did.The GPU is not that noisy, if you have ever had a high speed hard drive it is comparable to that, and yet to have had any heat issues, which I felt might be a concern because the massive size.I am also much happier with NVIDIA's control center, I found AMD's Catalyst to be annoying.Not sure what else to say but, I am a happy gamer!",

                "description": "Man... where to start?run on:  i5 4690, 8gb of DDR3 1600,  Z97 chipset motherboard.  Nothing overclocked (unless you count the factory overclock on this card)It's quiet, it's fast, and it is really gotta be the best bang for the buck in this price range.  It benchmarks well against the Radeon R9 280x for about the same price, and half of the power usage.  Yes, it won't stack up against the 970, and even two of these in SLI won't beat a 980 because 2gb plus 2gb doesn't equal 4gb in this scenario.  But really, for the price, this will play anything decently at 1080p. If I had a 4k monitor, I would have had to seriously consider going up to a much more expensive card... but considering that at the time of this review, I can only assume they make 4k monitors out of pure Unicorn tears, that probably isn't going to come up any time soon.Install was easy, though it is a tight squeeze in a standard mid tower case.  I had to move one of my hard drives to a lower bay to give the card enough clearance.I bought this as overkill to play the not terribly graphics intensive Guild Wars 2, which looks beautiful.  Ultra settings with everything maxed got me an average of 84FPS.  I had to frame limit it to 60.  I have yet to dip below that 60 that I notice, including with lots of action on screen.  This thing isn't even trying hard.  Fans have only come on intermittently.The benchmarks indicate that pretty much nothing currently out will give it a great deal of trouble at 1080p.  I think this is going to work out for quite some time for me.  And it runs so cool that it will probably last for ages.",

                "description": "Purchased for my first ever desktop computer custom build, designed for heavy gaming, but without blowing the bank account to smithereens, this graphics card really hit the right spot for me.  To start with, I chose NVIDIA over AMD for two main reasons:1 - AMD cards ALWAYS require more power, and use more power (substantially more) than the comparable NVIDIA cards (for example, this card will draw about 108 Watts in a gaming scenario, whereas the comparable AMD Radeon R9 285 in a comparable gaming scenario will draw about 176 Watts).  No, this difference isn't going to destroy an electric bill, but over time, it would add up, making the AMD card more expensive in the long run.2 - AMD cards typically run hotter than the comparable NVIDIA cards as well, not as much of a difference here, but I preferred to play it safe.Now why I chose the EVGA model?It didn't come down to much, just really chose something I figured would be solid.  I really liked that this card had a backplate, as well as so many connectivity options.  I also purchased the Super SuperClocked version, giving this card the biggest possible advantage for it being a 960, and EVGA's overclocking software is fairly convenient to use, especially when you're using one of their cards.On to actual thoughts:I really like this card.  I had really high hopes for how it would perform, and it holds up to most of those.  You won't be playing Dying Light or The Witcher III: Wild Hunt on completely maxed Ultra settings, that I can guarantee you.  But it does stand up very well to modern titles and is completely capable of playing anything on the market right now, at varying qualities, but it can play most titles around about one step down from Ultra.Read more ›",

                "description": "So far so good.  I upgraded to this R7 370 4g card to replace an aging Radeon 3870 HD in my Dell XPS 420.  It is a pretty significant upgrade from what I had before.  I did not really need to replace my 435w power supply with this card since the power draw was within 5w of my old card, but I went ahead and swapped out the old Dell 435w psu to a new Sentey 750w psu just to be safe.  This card is extremely quiet and runs cool.  Benchmarks are right where they should be based on what I've seen in online reviews.  Mine is actually fast even though my motherboard only supports PCIe 2.0.  So far my only gripe is that I can't watch any videos above 1080p without slow down and skipped frame rates in YouTube.  I don't believe this is the fault of the card though so much as it is my aging motherboard that can't keep up.  1080p plays fine for both games and videos so I think it's just my old computer.  If you have a faster newer computer, you results will no doubt be better than mine.  My processor is a Core 2 quad 6700 with 8gig DDR2 800mhz ram.  I bought this card mostly to beef up my old computer to get it ready for Windows 10 which I installed already.  This card uses the AMD catalyst software so you can go directly to AMD's site and get the latest and greatest drivers.  Windows 10 reached out and did the upgrade to the Windows 10 version of Catalyst automatically during the upgrade process so I didn't have to mess with it.  So far the card works perfectly with no noted issues in Windows 10 so for those of you wondering if this card will work correctly out of the box in Windows 10, I can say YES you will have no worries.",

                "description": "Went into this not expecting much more than an average card. Was more than impressed by the performance. The card itself sits well and is not overly big by all means. It can easily max out most modern titles at 60fps without breaking a sweat but will have to be toned down just a bit for more graphically intensive games. One of the better mid-range cards i've used and was actually my first venture into an AMD card. After noticing the strengths I went ahead and purchased another one for  another build I was working on. One negative side note would be the RAPTR game recording software it comes with. It is horrible and caused many unknown crashes on many of my games. Once I turned off the overlay and capture feature everything ran smoothly.",

It's not as slick as some of the higher priced models, but you get what you pay for. 60 fps on Fallout 4 at 900p (Old monitor maxes out at 1440x900 ) - Medium Detail. Minecraft also runs fine on this, 60fps + solid on vanilla Minecraft (Vsync off) and about 45-50 on modded Minecraft (FTB Packs. Vsync off). If you can afford better, both the R9 380 and the Geforce 960 are stronger cards, but if your budget focused like I am, you can accept some compromises, which is exactly what this card is.

                "description": "Great card the only problem is it would not fit my apevia xq pack 2 case because of the copper heat pipe. Not a problem for me though I put it in my other computer because it seemed like the older sapphire card I had was not fully compatible with the motherboard and would blue screen often my initial thoughts was that it was the memory sticks but I was wrong.. Mid level gaming on 1920x1080 is the sweet spot for most newer games and I have a  22 inch monitor which is the optimal resolution for that monitor.One of the many reasons I go time and time again to MSI is quality. They cover up all the connections with covers so they do not get damaged. The box itself was packaged well. The only downside I can think of is bundling of free games but that is a gimmick and I'm glad they didn't do that but it would of been  a nice bonus.I would recommend turning down the resolution to 1680x1050 on newer games though. The only regret I have is I didn't spend a little more and got the 4gb one, but then I realize a couple of things.One, that I don't do a whole lot of gaming plus another is  when I do I want it to have optimal performance for the type of monitor I have and this provides that, so in retrospect I'm happy overall. I don't play a lot of games that utilizes textures anyways and that is where the extra 2 gb would of been nice.This has some additional eyecandy in that it has color leds. If you have a see-through gaming case this would be relevant for that but I have no plans to upgrade my case. I might in a year or so because I prefer a better case that is see-through and I dented my existing  black non- see through case but that is further down the road and I'm not sure if I might.Read more ›",

                "description": "After many years of being a console gamer, I purchased a pre-built gaming PC a few years back for my 18th birthday. The only bottleneck in its performance was the GPU, an Nvidia GT610. While the PC was a huge step up from my last computer in terms of performance, it just wasn't cutting it. It was frustrating being unable to play newer games at higher resolutions. As an essentially broke college student (at the time) I grew upset and backed away from PC gaming for a while.Flash forward to early 2014. The media was abuzz with article after article boasting the performance of Nvidia's new card, the GTX 750ti, calling it an Xbox killer, PS4 slasher, all of that. \"Plays Titanfall better than Xbox One at 1080p\" was a frequent comment made by journalists referring to this card. I let the hype build in me until I finally decided to put my tax return towards this card. Is it as good as you'd think?  I've owned this card for about 6 months now.PROS:-Price point. $150 is super cheap for this level performance, though I imagine with more people finding out about this card, the price will rise. (I paid around $140 for mine after rebate.) I was beyond excited when I finally got it, and could see what it could do. For somebody who's just getting into building a PC, or upgrading their current desktop tower, I can definitely recommend this card as a great starting point!-Graphics capabilities. This card plays just about anything with ease. I enjoy playing games at 1080p and this allows me to do that for most games on high settings with minimal optimization. Straight out of a fresh game installation, you can expect to play most newer games at 35-60 FPS.Read more ›",

                "description": "If you're one of those folks who needs the biggest, baddest, etc, go buy yourself a Titan or a 780, or better yet, save yourself a few hundred and buy a 760.For many though, a video card is the make or break component that defines whether you'll be watching each frame as it pops on your screen or actually enjoying playing on your gaming PC.  For many that have an older system, or one that has an underpowered PSU, this is the best card you can get.  It's fully bus powered, and will let you run games like WoW on Ultra at 100fps.  More taxing games like Crysis will run at medium-high at 60fps.  Mind you this is all at 1080p.I built a DIY steam box, and was waiting for this card to come out.  It's quiet, doesn't get hot at all, and again, is bus powered.  So you can easily pop in this along with a decent core i5 and have yourself a great steam machine in a compact SFF case.This is a great card, bar none one of the best bang for the bucks out there.",

                "description": "This is the first card in Nvidia's new \"Maxwell\" architecture that would be the Geforce 8-series.  I think this is their first spin with the current process, and performance-wise fits into the 7-series right at the number the card has.  I think with the shrink we will see a similar (and probably a little faster) version of this card as the 850.  The level of performance is good, but in terms of the power and heat...it's among the best out there.It is very low power, but the performance is good enough for 1080p at a good frame rate with today's games.  I got this card for my Linux box, and with the 331.49 Linux 64-bit driver the card is detected correctly, and works just great, even in demanding games like Metro Last Light; at 1920*1200 the frame rate was smooth with nearly maximum settings (for Linux at least).  Driver support is of course very new (it wasn't correctly detected in the 331.20 set) so performance could very well improve even more.  So, basically even though you need Windows according to the box, the card works just fine in 64-bit Linux (both Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10).The card itself is very small and light.  It's not really very loud either.  There is no 6-pin connector; it draws all power through the slot.  Some cards are sold with that connector, but I think even with a high overclock, you may not even need it.  As to overclocking, I use it in Linux so I can't tell you that...but this is the superclocked version so it will run at over 1200Mhz boosted easily, as indicated in the specifications.",
